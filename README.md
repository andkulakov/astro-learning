# Welcome to [Astro](https://astro.build)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

Source files (`/src/`):
- `layouts` - shared layouts for all pages
- `locales` - translations can be placed there
- `pages` - Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in this directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.
- `scss` - SASS files (styles)
- `utils` - various supporting utils files

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                        |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
| `npm run build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `npm run preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |
